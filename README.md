## Design

* The website has a simplistic modern feel with the main colors black and white. 
* A few elements are green and those are the button in the contact-us form. and also the social media icons and the menu options, but those are only green while hovering. 

![Color Black](documentation/color-black.png)
![Color White](documentation/color-white.png)
![Color Green](documentation/color-green.png)

The logo, navigation bar, and footer were set to all pages with no change. In the content in between I kept a similar theme although the different sections and the two pages have a slightly different look. The purpose of this was for the visitor to acknowledge the different sections. This decision was made because a website with a lot of text can be overwhelming and therefore I wanted to make sure the sections did not melt into each other.

### Typography 

I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)  for all text. For the headlines, I used Bebas Neue Regular 400 and for paragraphs, I used Raleway Light 300.
#### Bebas Neue
