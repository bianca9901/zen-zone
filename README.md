## Design

The website has a simplistic modern feel with the main colors black and white. A few elements are green and those are the button in the contact-us form. and also the social media icons and the menu options, but these are only green while hovering. 

The logo, navigationbar and footer was set to all pages with no change. In the content in between I kept a similar theme although the different sections and the two pages but with a slightly different look. The purpose of this was for the visitor to acknowledge the different sections. This decision was made because a website with a lot of text can be overwhelming and therefore I wanted to make sure the sections did not melt into each other.

### Typogrophy 

I used Google Fonts for all text. For the headlines I used Bebas Neue Regular 400 and for paragraphs I used Raleway light 300.
