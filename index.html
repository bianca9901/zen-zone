            <h3>Yin yoga</h3>
            <p>
                A Chinese form of yoga where by staying longer in various sitting and lying positions we find a deep
                relaxation and meditation.
                Suitable for those who strive for increased flexibility in musculature in combination with the
                breath
                and the meditative.
                Gentle for you with sensitive joints and a perfect class to take when you need to find your inner
                peace.
            </p>

        <div id="class-2" class="class-options">
            <h3>Ashtanga yoga</h3>
            <p>
                In the Ashtanga class, we move very dynamically and hold various static positions where we
                strengthen
                the entire body's musculature.
                Here we use discipline and focus as the key to meditation. Finally, you get a long shavasana to
                relax
                in.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div id="class-3" class="class-options">
            <h3>Guided meditation for self-love 1hr.</h3>
            <p>Here, with the help of the noble art of hypnotherapy, we are guided into an inner journey to
                self-love. A
                trained yoga teacher and hypnotherapist, Tash Mind has conducted many life-changing sessions with
                those
                who have been open to deeply reprogramming the way they feel about themselves. This class is
                suitable
                for anyone who wants to increase self-love and thereby the quality of life.

            <h3>Tapping 1hr.</h3>
            <p>This relatively new method has been created to awaken and release pent-up emotions.
                Here, by physically touching different parts of your own body, you get the opportunity to come into
                contact with feelings that have not yet been processed.
                Be prepared for a strong experience. For those who are ready to heal and let go in a safe
                environment.
